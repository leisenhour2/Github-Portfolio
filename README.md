# Hi, I'm Larry Isenhour II 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a self-driven developer with a passion for clean code, real-world problem solving, and continuous learning.

I enjoy working with Python, building command-line tools, web scraping projects, and tackling new challenges. Take a look at some of my featured projects below!

##  Featured Projects

### **Eurogamer Web Scraper For Featured Blogs**  
**Category**:   Web Scraping (Intermediate)  
**Description**: This project scrapes blog data from eurogamer.net and exports it to JSON and CSV formats using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. I built it to practice web scraping, working with APIs, and processing external data.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests, JSON, CSV
- **Features**:
    - Scrapes blog titles, headlines, and metadata
    - Exports scraped data to both JSON and CSV files
    - Handles dynamic content through parsing HTML
- **How to Use**: Clone the repo and run `scraper.py` to extract and save blog data.

### **Hangman**  
**Category**:   Game Development (Beginner)  
**Description**: A simple command-line Hangman game built in Python that reads from an external text document `wordlist.txt` for words. This project helped me practice basic Python concepts, file handling, and control flow.

- **Tech Stack**: Python
- **Features**:
    - Simple text-based game
    - Randomly selects words from a file (`wordlist.txt`)
    - Allows players to guess letters and track attempts
- **How to Play**:
    - Clone the repo and run `hangman.py` in the terminal.
    - Follow the prompts to guess the letters of the word.
